   Summary
   
      1. Readability:
         - Avoid confusing language constructs.
         - Adhere to a consistent coding style.
      2. Performance:
         - Detect performance anti-patterns using static code analysis.
         - Examples include optimizing code inside loops and identifying concurrency problems.
      3. Reliability:
         - Detect reliability issues within individual components through static analysis.
         - Examples include identifying data race conditions, null pointer exceptions, and improper exception handling.
      4. Security:
         - Automated static scanning can detect security weaknesses.
         - Examples include finding weak cryptography, insecure framework configurations, and hard-coded security tokens.
      5. Dependency Management:
         - Consider third-party dependencies carefully.
         - Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor and identify security issues in dependencies.
         - SCA can detect security vulnerabilities, attacks on open source repositories, and backdoors injected by malicious committers.

   Summary
   
    1. Consistent Coding Style:
       - Follow a consistent coding style for readability.
       - Include indentation,proper naming,whitespace,comments etc.
    2. Strict Data Types:
       - Explicitly specify the data types to clarify variable data types.     
    3. Avoid Global Variables:
       - Minimize the use of global variables to prevent scope and naming conflicts.    
    4. Use an Autoloader:
       - Implement an autoloader to include necessary files automatically.
    5.Avoid Short Tags:
       - Always use standard PHP tags (<?php and ?>) to ensure compatibility across different environments.
    6. Version Control System:
       - Utilize a version control system like Git to track and manage code changes.
    7.Use a Framework:
     - Consider using a PHP framework (e.g., Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter) for structured development.
    8.Security Measures:
     - Keep security in mind to protect against common threats like SQL injection.    
    9.Stay Updated:
       - Continuously update your knowledge of PHP features, libraries, and best practices.
